// You have a test for a class and we want to know the average results for 
// the class. Write a function that takes an array of hash with all of the grades/marks 
// for a given test and returns an average grade for the entire class.
// Input are in JSON (be careful ruby users, "string": is not a symbol)

// it will take in a NAME AND A GRADE
// const person = [{}
// person ['name'] = 'bob';
// person ['grade'] = 65;
